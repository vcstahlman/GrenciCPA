/// Project goal: make a program for Dr. Anthony Grenci to use at his CPA firm to keep track of billing, and automate the calculation process.
/// Page: This is unused and it could be used as the spash screen. It just did not make sense since this page does not have much need for loading coverup, so it is unsued
